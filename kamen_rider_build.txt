Kamen Rider Build is a Japanese tokusatsu (live-action special effects) series and part of the long-running Kamen Rider franchise, which debuted in 2017. It is the 28th series in the Kamen Rider franchise and the 19th of the Heisei era. The story is set in a Japan that has been divided into three regions after the discovery of a mysterious alien artifact called Pandora's Box.

The protagonist of Kamen Rider Build is Sento Kiryu, a brilliant physicist with a mysterious past. He fights as Kamen Rider Build to protect Japan from the corrupt organization Faust and other threats arising from the chaos caused by Pandora's Box.

Device for Transformation: The Build Driver
To transform into Kamen Rider Build, Sento uses the Build Driver, a belt-like transformation device. The Build Driver requires two Fullbottles to initiate the transformation. Fullbottles are special vials containing the essence of different materials or life forms, such as "Rabbit" or "Tank." When two compatible Fullbottles are inserted into the Build Driver and turned, they combine to form a "Best Match," allowing Sento to transform into Kamen Rider Build with a specific form and powers, depending on the Fullbottles used.

One of the most iconic forms is RabbitTank, which is a combination of the Rabbit and Tank Fullbottles, giving Build enhanced speed and power.

Throughout the series, more Fullbottles and upgrades to the Build Driver are introduced, expanding the variety of transformations and abilities Build can utilize.
